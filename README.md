Hello, I'm Lucy! I'm a fourth-year math major at UChicago. 

I made [MathGloss](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/) with [Valeria de Paiva](https://vcvpaiva.github.io). I gave a [presentation](https://europroofnet.github.io/cambridge-2023/#horowitz) about it on September 7, 2023. I wrote about it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12649).

Last summer, I was an intern at NASA researching applications of simplicial topology to epistemic modal logic.

Two summers ago, I was a student at Budapest Semesters in Mathematics.

I have written two REU papers, one on the [Poincar√© group](https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2021/REUPapers/Horowitz.pdf) and one on the [smash product](https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2022/REUPapers/Horowitz.pdf).

Outside of math, I enjoy reading and music. I'm (slowly) teaching myself to play the accordion and the bass guitar.

Here is my [GitHub](https://github.com/lucyhorowitz).
